## Description
**_Restaurant Website that Uses Responsive Interface Design_** <br/>
The webpage designed in this project is for a fake restaurant called 'Riverside Burger Bash'. The webpage was created as an assignment in my Intro to Web Design class (CS 202) at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. In the process of designing the Riverside Burger Bash website, I followed a project prompt that was provided by the instructor of my web design course. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used in the process of planning the structure of the webpage. Useful features of web design such as the flexbox were included in the CSS code to help with the layout of different elements on the site. An important part of the project was incorporating responsive web design principles. Besides the table representing a sample bill with an order on the website, the project is responsive on different devices. A potential future update may include the use of JavaScript or a database to populate the data for the menu items of the website as opposed to static data in the html.

## **NOTE:**

The images used in this project were not created by me. I created the webpage as part of an assignment for my web design class at the [University of Wisconsin - La Crosse](https://www.uwlax.edu/). Therefore, I used images I found online for the Riverside Burger Bash webpage within an academic context. I have cited the image sources that I used. The image attributions are included in a separate document within this repository labled: "RBB-Image-Attributions".
